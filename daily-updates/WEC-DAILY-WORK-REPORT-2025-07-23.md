#### **Enhanced JavaScript Functionality**

*Updated `assets/js/learners-app.js` and `assets/js/learners-display-shortcode.js`*

**Anti-Interference System:**
* Aggressive event listener clearing to prevent external script conflicts with initials generation
* Namespaced events (.wecoza) for isolated functionality preventing interference
* Background monitoring system for initials field integrity with 2-second correction intervals
* Immediate correction timeouts for real-time field validation

**Cache-Busting Implementation:**
* `learners-plugin.php` - Dynamic timestamp versioning: `define('WECOZA_LEARNERS_VERSION', date('YmdHis'))`
* All script enqueuing updated to use timestamp-based versioning
* Ensures JavaScript changes are immediately reflected without browser cache issues

**Display Enhancement:**
* Updated `learners-display-shortcode.js` to use `fullName` property instead of `firstName`
* Enhanced search functionality to work with complete names including titles
* CSV export updated with "Full Name" header and proper formatted data mapping
* Table display now shows complete formatted names with titles

#### **Title Formatting Standardization (`491eff7`)**

*Consistent "Mr. John Smith" format with periods across all components*

* AJAX handlers: Enhanced to use `$learner->title . '. '` formatting
* Single learner display: Updated both header card and detail table locations
* JavaScript display: Complete transition from firstName to fullName property handling
* Search and export functionality: Updated to work seamlessly with formatted names

### WordPress URL Best Practices Implementation (`b86a25b`)

> **Scope:** 17 insertions, 9 deletions across 7 files

#### **Major Refactoring – URL Handling Standardization**

*Enhanced multiple files for WordPress compliance*

* Replaced manual URL concatenation with proper `home_url()` generation in PHP
* Added pre-generated URLs to all `wp_localize_script` calls for JavaScript access
* Updated JavaScript files to use provided URLs instead of manual string building
* Standardized URL patterns: `home_url('app/all-learners')`, `home_url('app/view-learner')`, `home_url('app/update-learners')`

### Delete Functionality Consolidation (`1e86abf`)

> **Scope:** 114 insertions, 155 deletions across 7 files

#### **Critical Bug Fixes & Code Consolidation**

*Major refactoring of delete functionality*

* **Universal Delete Handler**: Migrated delete functionality to global `learners-app.js` for universal coverage
* **Context-Aware Behavior**: Implemented smart delete behavior (table vs single page vs modal contexts)
* **Nonce Standardization**: Unified nonce usage to `'learners_nonce_action'` across all contexts
* **Bug Fixes**: Fixed portfolio `file_path` array access issue in single display shortcode
* **Performance**: Removed duplicate script loading preventing double confirmation dialogs

### Single Learner Display Page (`46d3d73`)

> **Scope:** 1,189 insertions, 230 deletions across 8 files

#### **Major Feature Implementation**

*Created comprehensive standalone learner view*

* **New Shortcode**: `[wecoza_single_learner_display]` for dedicated learner view pages
